solution: use on delete cascade to solve the foreign key constrait by making sure the items in the childtable are also deleted
alter table table_name
drop foreign key column name;

alter table table_name
add constraint column name
foreign key (name_of_column in current table) refereces (name_of_table and column referenced)
on delete cascade;
